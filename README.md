## Introduction
A **honeypot** is essentially a trap designed to attract adversaries. It works as a real vulnerable computer system, which any adversary can attack, and their attempts benefit us by allowing us to learn more about their attack mechanisms. Due to the sensitive nature of honeypots, it's highly recommended to follow certain best practices when it comes to deploying and managing a honeypot safely.
